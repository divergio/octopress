I really liked Google Reader's share functionality because it made it
very easy for my close friends and me to share links between
each other. We were all "following" each other on Reader.

### Before Google Reader

Before Google Reader, the old way of reading a shared link went
something like this:

* Come across the link on Facebook or Twitter or plain old e-mail
* Be forced to make a decision on if you wanted to read it now or later
* If later, you had manually add it into your own reading system
  (Instapaper, read it later)

This process is too active because the other person has to look for
the link and then take some direct action to put it in their
system.

### The Old Google Reader

In contrast, the old Google reader system was passive. If you chose to
follow me, then all my links came to you and were already in the
reading system you were used to (and maybe you had keyboard shortcuts
and iPhone apps to support it). 

That system was, unfortunately, locked to Google Reader, but most of
my friends were using Google Reader so it wasn't a problem.

### The New (not Improved) Way

Google recently redesigned Reader and tore out all of the old sharing
functionality and replaced it with a poor visual design and some
hacked on Google+ sharing features which they assumedly would prefer
us to use.

{" If I really wanted to share my links with Google+ I would have already been sharing the links through Twitter or Facebook. "} Nevermind
your feelings about Google+ as a social network, it is not a
replacement for the previous Reader functionality. The previous
sharing functionality put articles shared by friends directly into our
reading system, and didn't force a task change between "skimming
social network" and "reading RSS feeds" which the new system does.

"a good post about what has been lost") a
[lot of people](http://groups.google.com/group/google-reader-diaspora
"Google reader diaspora") who loved the previous functionality. 

### Solutions

I tried to craft a solution using a Tumblr blog to create an RSS of a  list of
links, but that doesn't solve one of the most critical features: full
text RSS feeds could be shared with full text. This was zero-friction
reading (combined with zero friction sharing with a single share button), and worked with peoples caching iPhone/Android Google Reader
apps. Unless I manually copy and paste the text and repost it on
my own site (which is questionable from a copyright standpoint), I
can't replicate this functionality.

### The Future

We could wait for a competitor to come out with a new RSS feed
service that offers the kind of sharing Google Reader had. This isn't
really satisfying, though, because I've already paid for a nice Google
Reader iPhone app, and because the website works fine except for the
crappier sharing functionality. Also, I don't want to have to convince
all my friends to jump ship. 

I think the best solution we can hope for is that Google *further*
integrates Google+ with Reader. Add a tab to Google Reader that lets you browse
your friend's Google+ posts as if they're RSS feeds. 

This wouldn't please everybody. Some peoples' use of Reader share
functionality apparently isn't replicable using Circles. For me,
though, I've got no problem using Google+'s circle metaphor to create
a sharing circle. I just want to read the shares in Google Reader, not
as links in a stream of status updates.
