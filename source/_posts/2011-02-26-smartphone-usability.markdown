I know I'm not the first one to [point][1] [this][2] [out][3], but I found that the modern smartphone solves (though probably also creates) many of the problems discussed in Donald Norman's ["The Design of Everyday Things"][4]

I know there is still a lot of work to be done, but I'm pretty happy with how many of the problems of task management, password memorization, and number memorization are solved by smartphones.
