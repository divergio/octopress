I've compiled a list of my favorite podcasts. 

Every once and a while I move somewhere where I have a long daily
commute. Suddenly I have a much higher demand in my life for audio
content. I have listened to some audio books, but I usually can't
focus on nonfiction audio books while commuting. Also, shorter
segments like podcasts can help give a sense of finality to a commute,
instead of leaving you excited to continue like an audio book might. 

I can understand if you don't *get* podcasts or think podcasts are for
those *other people*. Podcasts are probably
less efficient as a way of receiving information for most people,
because most can read faster than they listen and many podcasts have a
lot of extra banter. 

On the other hand, in the case of some of these podcasts you get
additional thoughts and get to borrow more of these peoples' time than
you would be able to if you only read their blog posts. They don't
write blog posts on every topic they think about, and it's much easier
for them to communicate these thoughts in the informal atmosphere of a
podcast.

In that spirit, I have compiled a list of my favorite
podcasts. Originally it was one post but the list went on so long that
I have split it into two section: general interest podcasts and Apple
podcasts. 

Posts are forthcoming. 

**Note: The title is a play on The Joy of Sex or The Joy of Cooking, but
I noticed
[I wasn't the only one to think of it](http://www.google.com/search?&q=%22The+Joy+of+Podcasts%22
"google search: joy of podcasts"), including some
[people](http://aprilmains.ca/2011/05/21/the-joy-of-podcasts/ "girl who
likes Build and Analyze, also") who like the
same podcasts as I do.**
