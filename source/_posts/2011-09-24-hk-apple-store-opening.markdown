Today, the International Financial Center mall location Apple
store on Hong Kong island has opened.

<!--more-->

It's not difficult to get Apple products in Hong Kong. You can order
from the Apple store, you can get an iPhone from the wireless
companies, or you can get them from various retailers throughout the
territory. 

Even when Apple products had delayed releases in Hong Kong, it was
always possible to get grey market products almost immediately, albeit
at a steep markup. In fact, impatient for the arrival of the iPad I
bought an Australian one from a small retailer in 2010. 

Before today,  if you wanted to see new Apple
computers in person you could find many small "Apple-style" stores in
computer markets across Hong Kong. They
didn't claim to be official Apple stores, but they sold only Apple products and
usually had glass windows and nice displays.

As Apple opened stores in Shanghai and Beijing, Hong Kongers could be forgiven for
feeling a bit jealous of their mainland compatriots. It was easy to
get Apple products in Hong Kong, but Hong Kong still lacked it's own
official, physical Apple presence. At long last, however, the wait is
over.

I didn't wait in line or even try to show up early in the morning. As
much of an Apple enthusiast as I am, I didn't think it worth lining up
merely for the opening of a new store as compared to the release of a new
product. I rolled into the store later in the evening around 7:30 PM.

At that time there was no line to get into the store but the store was
still busy and nearly full. As cynical as I am, the atmosphere of joy
and excitement was contagious. At the entrance there was a gauntlet of
chanting Apple store staff giving high fives to entering
customers. Inside, there were dozens of each kind of product, and it
wasn't hard to find an available device to play with. There was good,
upbeat music in the background (I heard Led Zep's "Ramble On"), and
there were many employees wandering around and looking for people to
help.

There were almost as many security personnel in black shirts as there
were staff. Earlier in the day they may have been more
necessary for crowd control, or perhaps Apple or the mall administration was actually concerned
about possible security problems. I don't know if this is typical of
Apple store openings elsewhere. Despite the huge security
presence it didn't feel overbearing. They just stood against the walls
and at the exits, and I didn't see them speak to anyone or discourage
anyone from doing anything.

I overheard a few exchanges between Apple store staff and
customers, and they seemed as knowledgeable and helpful as I've come
to expect elsewhere. I doubt Apple had much trouble finding people
enthusiastic about Apple products in Hong Kong, and I'm sure the
staff had been well trained. 

I talked to one of them and asked about how they were selling the
iPhone's. They were selling them alone or with contracts on Hong Kong
CSL. He asked if I wanted one so I took my iPhone 4 out of my pocket
and showed him that I already had one. I told him I was an iPhone developer and that I
lived in Hong Kong, so I wanted to check out the new store. He said he
had met another app developer earlier in the day who had iOS 5 on his
phone, to which I replied by showing him that mine, also, had iOS 5
installed. He tried to sell me a computer or an iPad, but I told him I
already had my Apple purchases planned out (iPad
with retina display in the spring, etc.) He saidI should come
back some time.

I read online that they had given T-shirts to the first 5000
visitors. The employee said that they ran out of those in the first
couple hours.

The store itself is two stories, with a central entrance on the bottom
floor. Each floor is split into two areas, and the two floors are
connected by a large spiral staircase. The bottom floor had Macbooks
on the left side and iOS and iPod devices on the right side. On the top floor
there were accessories and genius bars on the right side, and Apple
one-on-one teaching stations and purchasing areas on the left
side. The top floor has two exits, one on each side.

The presentation and organization was almost flawless, and as I said
the atmosphere was very upbead. However, in John Siracusa style, I did
notice a couple problems.

First, they were using iPad's to give product information. This seems
like a cool idea, because pricing and specifications can be updated
without having to print out a new information sheet, and also because
the customer can explore the iPad menu to find more information about
the product. It also helps with cross-promotion, because the customer
gets exposure to the iPad.

There is one problem with the iPad as product information system:  When I first saw the display I thought
the product *was* the iPad, and I was confused as to why they had locked
down its interface to make other apps inaccessible. Only after
wandering around and looking at other displays did I realize that the
iPad was only there to provide information about the iPhone or about
the iPod touch. I think the issue is that the iPad's large, bright
display was being used to sell much smaller products (even the iPod
nano). My attention was immediately captured by the iPad, and I barely
noticed the presence of the iPod touch. When I saw the same sales
tactic being used with the Macbooks or iMacs it made a lot more
sense. For those, the product wasn't overshadowed by the information
system.

The second problem was with the dock connector. The iPhone's and iPod
touches were connected to the tables by their dock connectors. They
weren't placed in a standard dock, instead there was some kind of
translucent assembly around the connector. Before
seeing store staff disconnect one from it's connector, I thought maybe this was an anti-theft
device, and I was uncertain about removing the the iPhone from its
position. Using a more familiar dock might make this more apparent. 

I'm still a little skeptical of the necessity of global Apple retail
store expansion. Maybe, as a power-user, I underestimate the usefulness of a single
point of contact for support and training. Regardless, the Apple store is a wonderful showcase
for Apple products, and as a person living in Hong Kong I look forward
to more store openings (perhaps Causeway Bay Times Square, or
somewhere in Tsim Sha Tsui?) in the future.
