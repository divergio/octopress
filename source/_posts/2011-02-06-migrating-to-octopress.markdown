I'm migrating the site to Octopress. I'm going to make a proper post about why I did it and hopefully start making a lot more posts, but for now I'm putting this here just in case I have any subscribers who are confused that all of my posts aren't marked as read.

A few things are still broken, and I want to make my own design, but I realized that I had already polished the Octopress blog more than my Wordpress blog, so I decided to launch.

I've still got a few bugs, but I've actually shut down the MySQL process and switched to a static site.
