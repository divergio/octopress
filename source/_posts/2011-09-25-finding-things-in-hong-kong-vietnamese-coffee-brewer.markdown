Finding things in Hong Kong is easy, as long as you know where to
look. Knowing where to look is the hard part.

<!--more-->

Things in Hong Kong are often sold in concentrated areas. There aren't
many general stores where you can get everything, instead there is something like a street devoted to selling bathroom fixtures, or a building with dozens of computer parts stores. There also is very little online shopping. 

If you're trying to get something, it's a question of finding out if
this cluster of stores exists for the thing you're looking for. For
example, I thought Hong Kong had very poor selection of headphones,
because in my computer market (the one I go to is in Mong Kok) they
only had crappy brands and poor selection. Later I found out that
actually headphones aren't sold at the computer market, and that there
is another market a few blocks away specializing in headphones that
had all of the brands I wanted.

It's difficult to determine which cluster the thing you're looking for
is in, if that cluster even exists, and where it is located. Sometimes there is only a vague, outdated post on
[Geoexpat](http://hongkong.geoexpat.com/ "Geoexpat forums"). So,
when, after much searching, I find the location of an obscure item, I
sometimes like to give back to the global internetworking knowledgesphere by
writing a post about it.

I've been enjoying Vietnamese food since freshman year of college in
Houston. There is a Little Saigon area of Houston with a ton of excellent
[pho](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ph%E1%BB%9F "wikipedia article about pho")
restaurants, and I often went there to enjoy a bowl of delicious
rice noodle soup. 

My favorite beverage to enjoy with these is
[Vietnamese Iced Coffee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_iced_coffee
"wikipedia article on ca phe da"). This is served by bringing out a
miniature, single-serving metal coffee brewer/filter. This is placed
over the cup and hot water is allowed to drip through the ground
beans and turn into coffee. This is mixed with ice and sweetened
condense milk to make a delicious drink. 

After introducing a friend in Hong Kong to pho, she said she really
loved the the way they made the coffee and wanted to try making it
like that in her apartment. As the experienced Hong Kong expat, I set
out on a mission to find the required miniature coffee brewer.

I tried all of the usual methods for finding cheap appliances: Japan Home, wet markets, City Super, and various Japanese department stores. All of these
methods failed, and I was about to give up. That is, until yesterday,
when while walking around in Yau Ma Tei we spotted a restaurant supply
store. The supply store had knives and pots and pans and all of the
equipment you needed to open a new restaurant, but most special of all
they had the Vietnamese coffee brewer. I can't remember the exact
Chinese name, I think it was called "越南滴漏咖啡壺."

We comparison shopped the surrounding area and found that the whole
area was full of restaurant supply stores, and a good portion of them
had the coffee brewer. The prices are similar to what I found on
websites in the US. They ranged from 42 HKD for the smallest, lowest
quality one up to 200 HKD for a nicely polished, luxury one. There were kinds with screw-down insert and also kinds with a
gravity insert, kinds with a handle, and kinds with the weird plastic
stubs on each side. We settled on a 65 HKD one which had good capacity and
reasonable quality (the company was Tantiendat).

To find this "restaurant supply" cluster  go to Yau Ma Tei station and take exit C. Then
walk west on Man Ming Lane until you hit Shanghai Street. Then you can
just wander up and down Shanghai Street looking at the various stores.

The location is Yau Ma Tei (油麻地) district on Shanghai Street (上海街) centered around Man Ming Lane (文明里).

Those looking for baking supplies (especially for baking cakes), quality knives, and all kinds of
pots and pans might also find what they are looking for in this
district.
