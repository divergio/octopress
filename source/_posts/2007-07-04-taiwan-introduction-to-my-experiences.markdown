I've been in Taiwan for about four weeks now.  After a bit of confusion getting to the apartment, I had no major issues.  I'm here for just the summer, learning Chinese at ICLP at the National Taiwanese University (台大).

Classes didn't start for two weeks, and I spent most of that time just bumming around and sleeping, recovering from finals period (I spent the previous semester on exchange at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology).
