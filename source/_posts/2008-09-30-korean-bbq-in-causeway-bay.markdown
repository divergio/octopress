We went looking for Korean barbeque one evening and found this place. It is about a three block walk from the MTR station. The atmosphere is very nice, the meat high quality with a lot of different selections, and the price reasonable. At the end it was $115-130 HKD per person. Service was also quite good, and the set meals were quite enjoyable. We went for dinner, though they had some nice looking lunch specials.

I had a friend who said that it was quite different from the experience in Korea, where the set meal is less common.  I can say it was also quite different from the all you can eat  (吃到飽) I had in Taiwan that was all self-service and you could choose any meat you wanted. However, it met my expectations of Korean barbeque as an American, providing an almost equivalent experience to the Korean barbeque I had in Houston.

I give it a thumbs up. So if you are in the mood for Korean BBQ near Causeway Bay, I recommend it.
