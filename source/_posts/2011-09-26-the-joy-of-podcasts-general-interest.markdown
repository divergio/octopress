This is the first in a small series of posts about my favorite
podcasts. I first began listening to podcasts as a way of keeping up
with the news on my bus commute to an internship in Houston. Before
ever being interested in technology podcasts, I listened to news and
culture podcasts. I've added some more in recent years, but some of
these I've been listening to for a long time.  

I describe these as general interest because they aren't technology
focused and they should appeal to any intelligent audience.

## This American Life 

**Run time**: about 60 minutes.
	
["This American Life"](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/ "this American life site") is hard to describe. They take a variety of
stories taking place in or related to America, and organized
around a theme depending on the show. Sometimes, though, they'll
do a whole show following just one story.
	
Hosted by Ira Glass, this show is always entertaining and
oftentimes informative. I look forward to it every week and I
listen to it regardless of whether I have a commute or not. It
also helps me feel a little bit more connected to the US when I am
abroad. 
	
I recommend this podcast without reservation to all audiences. 
	
## BBC Global News
	
**Run time**: less than 30 minutes.
	
For international news source I rely primary on the BBC World Service. The
[Global News podcast](http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/globalnews) is compiled twice a day, so whatever time
zone I am there is usually a pretty fresh one available. The only
exception is on weekends, when it's not published. 
		
The key thing to know is that Global News is just the highlights from
other BBC shows. It's short and sweet and to the point on different
news stories. If you only have time for one news podcast and you want
to get up to date with what is going on, this is the podcast.

If you have more time, want to hear longer interviews, or need a news
podcast on the weekend, I recommend the related podcast from the
Global Service,
[BBC Newshour](http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/newshour "BBC
Newshour podcast").

## NPR Intelligence Squared

**Run time**: less than hour.

Billed as "Oxford-style debating on this side of the Atlantic," [this
podcast](http://intelligencesquaredus.org/ "Intelligence Squared podcast") is recordings of live debates on various contentious topics related to
modern American life.

They only come out about once a month, but they're usually quite
interesting and very informative. Past topics have included:
* "Is the Two-Party System Making U.S. Ungovernable?"
* "Should Airports Use Racial And Religious Profiling?"
* "Is Islam a Religion Of Peace?"

## Other Podcasts

For whatever reason these podcasts aren't listed as my top
recommendations, but I still listen to them.

They are for the most part still top notch, but might be less reliable
week-to-week (i.e. the occasional bad episode). I might also only
listen to them occasionally when I've run out of the main ones. For others, I might
still be giving them a chance to impress me. 

### On The Media

**Run time**: less than an hour.

[On The Media](http://www.onthemedia.org/ "On the media") is quality analysis of media bias. Each show takes an
investigative approach around one topic. I'm not sure why I put this
in the "other podcasts" section. When I switched podcast programs I
think I forgot to add this, so I just haven't listened to it in a
while. I would definitely give this a try, especially if you are
interested in any of their topics. 

### Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!

**Run time**: less than an hour.

This is a
[quiz show from NPR](http://www.npr.org/programs/wait-wait-dont-tell-me/
"link to wait wait don't tell me"). It's usually pretty funny, but sometimes
I don't get the jokes because I'm not hooked into the 24 hour news
cycle in the US (many of the questions are related to the news of the
week, and it's usually US-centric). They get political and entertainment figures on the
show sometimes, and they are usually pretty funny. This is something
to try out and see if you like the format. 

**Look for more podcast recommendations soon.**
