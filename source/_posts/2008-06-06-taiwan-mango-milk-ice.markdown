I miss a lot of things about Taiwan, but the thing I miss the most is the dessert I had almost every day: Mango Milk Ice (芒果牛奶冰).<!--more-->

Rather than describe it, I'll point you to a <a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3269/2555305338_8bf21ab7f8_o.png">slide</a> I made for a presentation I gave on Taiwan.

There are a lot of places you can get decent milk ice. A chain called 3 Brothers (三兄弟) makes a decent bowl, but my favorite place is a place near Gongguan station 公館站).

The way to get there is to take the station exit across from the main National Taiwan University entrance. After that, you head northwest, pass a couple alleys, and then turn left at alley 316. Walk a couple blocks and on your right you'll see this:

Here, some <a href="http://www.wretch.cc/blog/nally/6422299">random Asian person</a> who also likes this place:
Note: You can get flavors other than mango if you like.

My recommendation is to go to Gongguan, wander around the neighborhood and find a place to eat (there are a ton of places), then go to the ice place afterwards for dessert.

As an aside, across the street is my favorite milk boba tea place, called 青蛙. It's just a little stand, but in the afternoon there is always a line. I can honestly say it's the most delicious 珍珠奶茶 I've ever had.  Unfortunately, I would usually be so full after dessert that I rarely went there. Still, check it out sometime.
