I've compiled a list of my favorite podcasts. 

Every once and a while I move somewhere where I have a long daily
commute. Suddenly I have a much higher demand in my life for audio
content. I have listened to some audio books, but I usually can't
focus on nonfiction audio books while commuting. Also, shorter
segments like podcasts can help give a sense of finality to a commute,
instead of leaving you excited to continue like an audio book might.

I can understand if you don't *get* podcasts or think podcasts are for
those *other people*. Podcasts are probably
less efficient as a way of receiving information for most people,
because most can read faster than they listen and many podcasts have a
lot of extra banter. 

On the other hand, in the case of some of these podcasts you get
additional thoughts and get to borrow more of these peoples' time than
you would be able to if you only read their blog posts. They don't
write blog posts on every topic they think about, and it's much easier
for them to communicate these thoughts in the informal atmosphere of a
podcast.

So, without further ado, here is my list of recent favorite
podcasts.

## This American Life 

**Run time**: about 60 minutes.
	
["This American Life"](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/ "this American life site") is hard to describe. They take a variety of
stories taking place in or related to America, and organized
around a theme depending on the show. Sometimes, though, they'll
do a whole show following just one story.
	
Hosted by Ira Glass, this show is always entertaining and
oftentimes informative. I look forward to it every week and I
listen to it regardless of whether I have a commute or not. It
also helps me feel a little bit more connected to the US when I am
abroad. 
	
I recommend this podcast without reservation to all audiences. 
	
## BBC Global News
	
**Run time**: less than 30 minutes.
	
For international news source I rely primary on the BBC World Service. The
[Global News podcast](http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/globalnews) is compiled twice a day, so whatever time
zone I am there is usually a pretty fresh one available. The only
exception is on weekends, when it's not published. 
		
The key thing to know is that Global News is just the highlights from
other BBC shows. It's short and sweet and to the point on different
news stories. If you only have time for one news podcast and you want
to get up to date with what is going on, this is the podcast.

If you have more time, want to hear longer interviews, or need a news
podcast on the weekend, I recommend the related podcast from the
Global Service,
[BBC Newshour](http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/newshour "BBC
Newshour podcast").

## NPR Intelligence Squared

**Run time**: less than hour.

Billed as "Oxford-style debating on this side of the Atlantic," [this
podcast](http://intelligencesquaredus.org/ "Intelligence Squared podcast") is recordings of live debates on various contentious topics related to
modern American life.

They only come out about once a month, but they're usually quite
interesting and very informative. Past topics have included:
* "Is the Two-Party System Making U.S. Ungovernable?"
* "Should Airports Use Racial And Religious Profiling?"
* "Is Islam a Religion Of Peace?"

## Build and Analyze

**Run time**: over an hour, less than two hours.

This is an [excellent podcast](http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze "build and
analyze podcast") hosted by Marco Arment and Dan Benjamin. Ostensibly it's about the world of iOS development and mobile devices,
but the hosts stray into all manner of topics. I originally listened
to this as an aspiring iOS developer and because I had used the main
host Marco Arment's excellent Instapaper
[service](http://www.instapaper.com "Instapaper service") and
[app](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instapaper/id288545208
"Instapaper app") and then
discovered the podcast through his equally excellent
[blog](http://www.marco.org/ "Marco.org blog"). After listening to it,
however, I got to like to listening to the guy and now I never miss it
each week.

### Hypercritical

[Another podcast](http://5by5.tv/hypercritical "Hypercritical podcast") from the 5by5 network. Once you start listening to one
you hear the hosts mentioning the other podcasts because many of them
listen to each other. 

This podcast is hosted by John Siracusa and Dan Benjamin, perhaps best known for his
lengthy and thorough reviews of each new OS X release on Ars
Technica. 

Siracusa offers good analysis of the mobile space with an Apple
focus. He's also a geek and sometimes they talk about home theater or
Star Wars or other various geeky topics.

One of my favorite episodes demonstrating Siracusa's take on business strategy
in the technology world is 
[episode 31](http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/31 "Strong arguments for and
against episode") where they discuss HP's exist from the PC business
and the effect of that move on Micrsoft. Also, it's a bit dated now that Amazon's device is revealed to be running
an Android fork, but they talk about the pros and cons of Amazon
potentially buying webOS to use for their new tablet. 


## The Critical Path

**Run time**: less than an hour.

[Listening to
Horace Dediu](http://5by5.tv/criticalpath "Critical Path podcast) makes me feel like I am. He's got a lot of insightful analysis of
technology companies and the phone and mobile space. He's a bit more
serious than the other hosts on 5by5, and he leverages his experience
in the industry to give keen insights. He writes on his blog
[Asymco](http://asymco.com/ "Asymco website"), but those posts tend to be more about numbers and
financials. On the podcast he has more business and strategy
analysis. He is apparently actually a go-to guy for a lot of
heavyweight publications when they want opinions on the telecom and
mobile industries, so I feel grateful to get his time and analysis
basically for free.

### An aside about 5by5

All of the previous few podcasts are co-hosted by
Dan Benjamin, who runs the 5by5 network. Dan Benjamin is a really
likeable guy and he's clearly very skilled at running such a successful podcast network. However, I have some
reservations about his role on a lot of the shows. I can't count the
number of times that as an audience member I understood exactly what
one of the hosts was saying when Dan would make some kind of off-topic
remark that didn't much advance the conversation.

In my opinion he is most in his element talking to Merlin Mann or
Horace Dediu, but when placed beside John Gruber, John Siracusa, or
especially Marco Arment, sometimes I get frustrated when he sidetracks
the host too much. I don't question his credentials as a long time Mac
user and developer, but he has trouble keeping up with some of his
co-hosts. 

I still believe in the strength of his two or one host style. So many of the
podcasts I tried listening to on other networks try to pile on half a
dozen hosts to try to cover up the fact that none of them are
interesting by themselves. The result is too much chatter, and rarely
anything interesting is said. 

I see his role as something like a foil, to highlight and complement the main host and
to keep them talking. When he strays from this role he can be a distraction, but
not enough to cause me to discontinue listening to any of these
shows. 

However, when he was on his hiatus and Merlin Mann took over for him
on "The Talk Show," it brought this problem into sharp contrast. John
Gruber is normally pretty staid and unenthusiastic, but with Merlin
he was excited and they talked for over two hours.

This particular anecdote may not be a fair comparison. Merlin Mann is one of the most
charismatic characters on the internet, and he was put in a new
situation for a one-off show. Maybe if he had to do it every week it
wouldn't be quite so exciting. Also, with Merlin they got way off topic and
ended up talking for over two hours about many strange topics. This is
good sometimes, but maybe Dan is better at keeping the host in the
advertised specialty of the podcast. 

Nevertheless, it was in my opinion one of the most entertaining
episodes of the Talk Show in
recent memory. At the very least it should give Dan Benjamin pause to
be aware of his limitations and to recognize when he is a limiting
factor on some of his shows. Giving that show a listen (which he still
hasn't, according to Merlin's most recent show), might give him ideas
about how to make his excellent shows even better. 

## Other Podcasts

For whatever reason these podcasts aren't listed in my top
recommendations, but I still listen to them when I have to fill my
twice daily 45 minutes commute during the work week.

They are for the most part still top notch, but might be less reliable
week-to-week (i.e. the occasional bad episode). I might also only
listen to them occasionally when I've run out of the main ones. For others, I might
still be giving them a chance to impress me. 

### Back to Work

**Run Time**: around an hour.

I'm still not quite sure what [this podcast](http://5by5.tv/b2w  "Back to Work podcast") is about. Merlin Mann is
really famous from his days, now behind him, as a productivity
guru. They talk about work/life balance stuff, philosophy of work,
etc.

Listening to this podcast I often have some epiphany about how I'm
doing my work or making decisions. It's also quite entertaining,
mainly because Merlin Mann is an intensely likeable and very funny guy. 

The only reason this podcast isn't in my top recommended section is
because I'm still not sure what the podcast is even about. It's seems
like sometimes they ramble on forever. I still enjoy it, but I would
recommend the other podcasts above first.

### The Talk Show

**Run time**: nearly two hours.

This show is hosted by Dan Benjamin and John Gruber of [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/
"daring fireball site") fame. The content is similar to Hypercritical
and Build and Analyze, they are usually discussing the same topics,
with maybe a slightly different angle. 

Depending on when Apple news
comes out one of these podcasts will get the first chance to comment,
and then the others will have their own unique take. This is the main reason I
listen to all of them. The only reason I put Gruber's show in this
"other podcast" section is
because I personally like Siracusa's or Arment's speaking style more,
and would recommend them first.

## On The Media

**Run time**: less than an hour.

[On The Media](http://www.onthemedia.org/ "On the media") is quality analysis of media bias. Each show takes an
investigative approach around one topic. I'm not sure why I put this
in the "other podcasts" section. When I switched podcast programs I
think I forgot to add this, so I just haven't listened to it in a
while. I would definitely give this a try, especially if you are
interested in any of their topics. 

## Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!

**Run time**: less than an hour.

This is a
[quiz show from NPR](http://www.npr.org/programs/wait-wait-dont-tell-me/
"link to wait wait don't tell me"). It's usually pretty funny, but sometimes
I don't get the jokes because I'm not hooked into the 24 hour news
cycle in the US (many of the questions are related to the news of the
week, and it's usually US-centric). They get political and entertainment figures on the
show sometimes, and they are usually pretty funny. This is something
to try out and see if you like the format. 

### Android or Non-Apple 

You may have noticed that the bulk of the technology podcasts I listen
to are focused on Apple. I admit my strong interest in all things
Apple. I use their products and aspire to create great applications on
their platforms. 

However, upon realizing that all of the podcasts I listen to are Apple
analysis (though they often discuss other parts of the mobile space),
I wanted to find some views from the other side. 

I went in search of podcasts about Android or non-Apple mobile
technology, if only to check my biases and make sure my vision doesn't
become constrained. 

I asked Android developer friends and searched rather exhaustively. I
ended up finding a few different shows:
* **This Week in Tech**: Okay, but kind of boring.
* **This Week in Google**: Same. 
* **Motodev**: Too technical, not what I'm looking for.
* **All About Android**: stopped after five minutes, too chatty. 
* **Android Central Podcast**: see below.

I listened to an entire episode of Android Central podcast. I wasn't
very impressed with the analysis or attitude. They seemed noncommital
and nonjudgmental for too many things. They were unwilling to state an
opinion and defend it, and more likely to equivocate as compared to
the 5by5 hosts who are willing to call a spade a spade and point out
when something is poorly designed and unlikely to be used or
appreciated by most people. For example, in the episode I listened to
no one was willing to say anything bad about the failed HP Touch
Pad. No one would state the obvious that buying a device which is
unlikely to be supported in the future probably isn't a very good
idea, and that it doesn't make much sense to buy another gadget just
to have it lying around the house (an attitude I grew out of years
ago). The one exception is the occasional co-host who has a strong
anti-Apple stance, but in the episode I listened to they just dismissed Apple and didn't give
any critical feedback.

This podcast also seemed to adopt the "pile on the host" podcasting philosophy
which I mentioned earlier. The same criticisms apply to a
lesser extent to Leo Laporte's podcasts (the first two listed). I
found them okay but not interesting enough to keep me coming back.

Maybe I am so trapped in Apple's "reality distortion field" that these
podcasts are actually full of mature, insightful analysis, or maybe
for whatever reason there is just less market for this kind of podcast in the non-Apple
world. Regardless, if anyone has some further recommendations I'm open
to trying out some other technology podcasts. Maybe if Metro is a hit
some Microsoft podcasts will start giving a Microsoft view of the
mobile space.

**Well, that is all, a fairly exhaustive listing of almost all of the
  podcasts checked in my podcasting app. I hope this has been useful
  to some people out there. **
