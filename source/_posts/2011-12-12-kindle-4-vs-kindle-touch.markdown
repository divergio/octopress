I've never owned an e-ink reader, though I've wanted to for a long
time. Every few years I check the
[E-book reader matrix](http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/E-book_Reader_Matrix
"e-book reader matrix") to see what the state of the art is. In the
past I might have been an early adopter, but the expense and
performance of early systems wasn't enough to convince me to try
them. Until now I was able to make do with the Kindle app on my first
generation iPad, and of course physical books.

But finally, the price of the Kindle was so low that I decided to take
the plunge. Touch sounds like a great idea, but according to
[trusted internet authorities](http://www.marco.org/2011/12/02/kindle-touch-vs-nook-simple-touch-kobo-touch-kindle-4
"marco's touch review") the touch implementation was
clunky. Combined with a review which poked my nostalgia
button by describing the Kindle 4 as something out of Star Trek
because of how lightweight it was, my decision was sealed and I
ordered the Kindle 4.

Talk about first world problems, but I immediately had buyers remorse
upon receiving my Kindle 4. It feels like a great product, but some of
the things that were so easy to do with the iPad app were difficult
using the Kindle 4's buttons. I ordered a Kindle Touch and decided to
compare the two.

#Background

You should read this if:

* You've decided on a Kindle, for whatever reason (you're tied in to
Amazon, you like Amazon's selection, whatever)
* You're trying to decide between the Kindle Touch and the Kindle 4

Briefly, I'll give my justification for those two requirements.

I'm using Amazon because I'm already used to buying books on Amazon, and they have support
across all platforms. I can't see a compelling reason to use iBooks or
Nook or some other platform when Amazon seems like the most reliable and
seems to have the best selection. Amazon is king, and they're the one
I most expect to be around in ten years. When we're talking about
DRM'ed eBooks, that matters. 

I've been impressed with their iPad app, and I even read a few whole
novels on my iPad when I was unable to buy them because I was
overseas. The iPad reading experience was surprisingly good, but I've
still sought a dedicated device using e-ink because it is better on
the eyes and better for reading lengthy text. 

I would choose the Touch or 4 over the Kindle Keyboard because I don't think
any ebook readers are good for taking notes, and I think the keyboard
is just extra weight and and a waste of space for something I'm
reading on only. I've also only looked
at the wi-fi ones because I don't see any reason to get the 3G, and I
travel overseas where I don't even think the 3G works anyway. 

#Continuing...

After receiving the Kindle Touch, I immediately noticed two
shortcomings. First, looking up definitions for words is a
hastle. Second, viewing footnotes is a pain. 

I was used to very easily looking up definitions on the Kindle app for
iPad. I'm still learning new words
all of the time, and if I'm reading a challenging book I often want to
see definitions. On the iPad, it was a matter of holding your finger
over the word for a second, and then seeing a definition appear at the
bottom of the screen. The Kindle Touch isn't much faster than the
Kindle 4 for looking up definitions, but it is easier. Just put your
finger on the word and the definition will pop up. I don't like that
it pops up. The popup has to be closed manually, and I would prefer if
the definition just shows up in the same way as
the Kindle 4 or the iPad, but the ease of use of touching the word is a huge
advantage over the flurry of button presses to navigate to the correct
line and word on the Kindle 4. It's not that difficult, but the
additional hassle quickly makes you more reluctant to look up
definitions. 

Footnotes are implemented differently in different eBooks. Some
publishers do a terrible job and don't embed links for the footnote
numbers. In this case, the Kindle 4 or Touch are both equally
handicapped. However, if the publishers do a better job and make each
footnote a link to a footnote section, then the Touch works much
better. You just put your finger over the footnote, and it jumps back
to the appropriate section. To go back, you bring up the menu and
press the back button. Using the touch screen to perform this
operation is a little troublesome because of the delay, and I think
it could still stand to be improved in terms of usability.
Nonetheless, the situation is an improvement over the Kindle 4, where
in the same manner as the definitions you must select the footnote using the jog switch.  

#Conclusion 

My only reservations with the Touch are that it feels very much like a
first generation product. Whereas the Kindle 4 is a beautiful, stripped down and perfected
fourth generation minimalist e-ink reader, the Kindle Touch is an awkward first
revision. They wanted to go all out with the touch capability, but I still think the
physical page turning buttons are a necessity on an e-reader. They
crammed in a bunch of
additional features (double battery life, music player, text to
speech) which I don't think are necessary in an e-reader. The bezel is
deeper to make room for the touch sensing, which makes it feel less polished. The result
is something which is noticeably heavier and feels clunkier to navigate. 

My ideal Kindle would strip out as many of the extraneous features
that the Touch offers in order to become more like the Kindle 4
(lightweight, physical buttons for page turning), but keeping the
touch screen for definitions and footnotes. I'm hoping this is what
Amazon does for their second generation Kindle Touch. 

So, in summation, I think that if you would potentially read a
nonfiction book or a book with a lot of footnotes, or if you are the
kind who often looks up word definitions, then the Kindle Touch,
despite its flaws, will serve you better.

If you are just reading novels and rarely look up words, the Kindle 4
will work fine, and, because it weighs less and is more polished, will feel more like the
future.
