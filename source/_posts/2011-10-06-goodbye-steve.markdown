When Steve Jobs resigned, a lot of us still had hopes that it was
temporary. We hoped maybe he would recover and, maybe even a short
time later, come back to Apple energized and ready to share some more
magic. 

Of course, this was wishful thinking. It seems now that Steve
understood his fate and stepped down in August to spend time with his
family and to help prepare Apple to stand alone.

As a jaded cynic born in the 80s, I never had many heroes. Those I did
have were technologists: Elon Musk, K. Eric Drexler, John Carmack. 

I discovered Apple pretty late. I never owned an Apple II. My only
experiences with Apple products were on the underpowered school
computers and the silly technicolor clamshell Macs in my high school
computer science class. At that time I felt like Macs were
underpowered, with a UI like a toy computer. Besides, I played video
games and the only proper operating system for a gamer was Windows 98
or Windows XP.

In my senior year of college all this changed. A few close friends of
mine were switching to Apple. I was able to try out their machines and
they explained what they liked about them. I was impressed with the build quality and attention to detail. I
wasn't much of a gamer any more, so the underpowered graphics weren't
much of a concern. In my programming classes I had come to respect the power of UNIX-like
systems, and I was impressed that OS X was built on BSD.

My laptop was due for an upgrade, so in a short time I went from
having no
Apple products to being an iPod touch carrying Macbook user.

As a gadget geek, I had owned Windows Mobile and Palm devices in the
past. I even relied on an ancient Windows Mobile PDA for my Chinese
dictionary. Of course, I had played around with its browser and mail
client in the past, but they were such a pain to use that I eventually
disabled them all in order to increase the performance of the
dictionary. Mobile devices seemed like toys, fun to try out but too
irritating to actually be useful day-to-day.

As I saw the iPhone blossom and experienced the increasing utility of the iPod
touch, my skepticism about the value of mobile computing disappeared.

Soon enough, I was working to convert my friends and family to Macs
and iPhones, not only for their own experience but also to make it
easier for me to provide (or not have to provide) technical support.

I started checking Apple news sites daily, subscribing to Apple
podcasts, and envisioning a career where Apple products are a central
focus.

In that short space of three years, Steve Jobs became a hero to me. An exemplar of a
true visionary: a man who, seeing in his mind a world which doesn't
exist, through his actions brought his vision closer to reality.

We've lost a great man, an inspiring man. He brought us a long
way. Let's all try to go farther.
