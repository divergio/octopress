Maybe the joke is on me for writing a usability and user interface design critique on something as convoluted as emacs, but I found this dialog so ridiculous I could not resist.

I commend the efforts of the Aquamacs group in making an emacs that can integrate with OS X in a relatively painless fashion, as well as look much nicer than something using X11.

However, I question the UI design choices that led to the creation of this dialog box that popped up when I tried closing out of the program:

Powerful, maybe, but elegant? Not to mention the fact that, despite being familiar with all of the options, it took me a good thirty seconds to finally choose the appropriate response.
