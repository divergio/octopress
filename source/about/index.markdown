Iâ€™m just a programmer trying to explore the world as much as I
can. This blog is a place for my technology writing, random thoughts,
and travelogues.

My audience is primarily friends/family, but perhaps some random Internet traveler will extract some value from a post or two. I sometimes make lengthy picture posts.
