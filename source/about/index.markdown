_I'm just a programmer trying to explore the world._

My name is Tyler Barth, I'm an iOS developer and User Experience designer based in Taipei. 

This blog is a place for my technology writing, random thoughts,
and occasionally stories.

You can probably imagine a gmail address based on my domain name if you wanted to write me. 

My code is on [github](http://github.com/divergio "divergio github"), though most of my projects are private right now.
